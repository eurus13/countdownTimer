# countdownTimer
Building countdown timer with Javascript. Nothing groundbreaking, just needed a countdown timer for my website for an artshow and wanted to better understand the mechanics of the premade one I chose to use.


USAGE:

 -BE SURE to update the date in setCountDownDate() function to set Stop Date for your timer. 

- HTML files comes with script attached

- .js file is set to work with the following:
<div id="timer"></div>
